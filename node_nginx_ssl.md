# Node.js NGINX Deployment 

> Steps to deploy a Node.js app to [Database Mart](https://www.databasemart.com/) using PM2, NGINX as a reverse proxy and an SSL from LetsEncrypt

## 1. Sign up for VPS or Dedicated Server with Linux Ubuntu OS
In this tutorial is using [Database Mart VPS](https://www.databasemart.com/vps-hosting)

## 2. Connect to the ordered VPS server using ssh remote
Open cmd or terminal in Windows. but I prefer to use terminal in this case and it recommended.
```bash
# I am using administrator as username for my vps. but in some vps provider using root as username.
ssh administrator@vps_ip_address
```

## 3. Install Node/NPM into the VPS Unbuntu server
```bash
# Download and install nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.2/install.sh | bash

# in lieu of restarting the shell
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

# Download and install Node.js:
nvm install 20

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v20.19.0".
nvm current # Should print "v20.19.0".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "10.8.2".
```

## 4. Clone your project from Github
There are a few ways to get your files on to the server, I would suggest using Git
```bash
# Clone your nodejs project from github repository.
git clone yourproject.git
```

### 5. Install dependencies and test app
```bash
# Navigate to the nodejs project directory.
cd yourproject

# Now install all the necessary dependencies in the package.json
npm install

# Run the app with the start command.
npm start

# Stop app
Ctrl + C
```
## 6. Setup PM2 process manager to keep your app running
```bash
# Install pm2 to manage and monitor the nodejs app.
sudo npm install -g pm2

# Navigate to the current app project directory.
cd yourproject

# Now we can start the nodejs app in the current project directory by run the command below.
pm2 start "npm start"

# Useful command for pm2 ðŸ‘‡

# List all processing instance
pm2 list

# Check processing instance status
pm2 status

# Stop the current processing instance with id 0
pm2 stop 0

# Delete the current processing instance with id 0
pm2 delete 0

# To make sure app starts when reboot
pm2 startup ubuntu
```
### You should now be able to access your app using your IP and port. Now we want to setup a firewall blocking that port and setup NGINX as a reverse proxy so we can access it directly using port 80 (http)

## 7. Setup ufw firewall
```bash
# Enable firewall network
sudo ufw enable

# Check for the firewall network status
sudo ufw status

# Allow the ssh port for firewall network to be accessable from remote ssh.
sudo ufw allow ssh (Port 22)

# Allow http request to be accessable from everywhere.
sudo ufw allow http (Port 80)

# Allow https request to be accessable from everywhere.
sudo ufw allow https (Port 443)
```

## 8. Install NGINX and configure
```bash
# Install nginx into the Ubuntu server.
sudo apt install nginx

# Edit the default nginx config file with the following configuration below.
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
Add the following configuration to the location part of the server block
```nginxconf
server_name domain.com www.domain.com;

location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; #whatever port your app runs on
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```
The config file should be look like this
```nginxconf
# Default server configuration
#
server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;

	root /var/www/html;
        
	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        # domain.com and www.domain.com is the domain that we will buy in the step 9 below.
	server_name domain.com www.domain.com;
        
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; #whatever port your app runs on
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
}
```

```bash
# Check the NGINX config file format is correct or not
sudo nginx -t

# Restart NGINX server
sudo service nginx restart
```

### You should now be able to visit your IP with no port (port 80) and see your app.

## 9. Add custom domain name
Now goto buy a domain name from any domain provider. but in this case I prefer to use [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) as domain provider.

Now add some dns record to the domain:
- Add A record for @ and value is the vps ip address.
- Add A record for wwww and value is the vps ip address same as A record above.

It may take a bit to propogate
And you can

10. Add SSL with LetsEncrypt
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com

# Only valid for 90 days, test the renewal process with
certbot renew --dry-run
```

Now visit https://yourdomain.com and you should see your Node app
